# APN-110-Presentations-

Thanks to the ADs and Chairs of the following areas and working groups, in this IETF110, we have made presentations in the four areas which triggered a lot of active discussions and through which we collected very valuable comments and feedback. Especially those information collected from the experts in ART and SAAG made us obtain the views and concerns from new angles. Although most of the concerns were because of the walls between different areas, we did find that these feedback really helped us to focus on addressing the confusions in our presentations of the work.
